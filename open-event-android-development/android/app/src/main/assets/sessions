To some, switch mode converters are mysterious devices yet the basic principles of switch mode converters are fairly simple. This introductory class presents the principles and concepts of switch mode converters and lays the foundation needed for the more advanced power conversion classes. The class starts with a description of the basic components and circuits used in switch mode converters. Next, the fundamental principles of energy storage and processing common to all switch mode converters, inductor volt-second and capacitor charge balance, are presented. Using these principles, the operation of the most common switch mode converters is explained. Converters discussed in some detail include the buck, the boost, the forward, and the flyback converters. The class concludes with a survey of other common and important switch mode power converter topologies. After this class it is suggested than those interested in switch mode power take class 21098 PC2 which provides an introduction to feedback and control loops for switch mode power converters.</p>",

The simple demonstration involves monitoring and regulating water supply to the plant using sensors and actuators. What is a gateway and do I really need one? Consider a scenario where 100s of plants wants to connect to cloud thought a common Wi-Fi router - is this be possible? It is possible with additional routers and proper traffic management of data, but all this adds overhead cost to the setup because WiFi router has its limitations with the number of independent stations it can connect to. But with the help of gateways it is possible to achieve the same with less complexity and better power management. Gateways are simple systems consisting of WiFi Module and 802.15.4 transceiver running a Mesh stack (ZigBee). The 802.15.4 transceiver collects the data in its network and passes the data to the gateway for transmission. The gateway in our demo stores the received information from the plants and converts it into packets that can be sent to the cloud through WiFi, thus reducing the stress on the router. The demo consists of two custom made plant pots that store water for plants and water the plants when needed with the help of sensors and actuators. The real-time stats like amount of water consumed, moisture level and water level are displayed in real time on a portable device connected to a local server or internet. </p>",

While 21097 PC1 is not a prerequisite, this class builds on the concepts presented in that class. This introductory class focuses more on the concepts and principles than detailed design. The class starts with a review of describing systems in the frequency domain, transfer functions, and feedback loop characteristics that govern stability and performance. Then each element of analog feedback controllers are presented and discussed: the error amplifier, the compensator, and the modulator. Particular attention is paid to designing the control loop frequency response to achieve both stability and good performance. While there is a fair amount of algebra used the focus of the discussion is on understanding the concepts and principles. The last part of the class is an overview of current mode control and its advantages. After this class those interested in designing power converter control loops with digital control should take class 21099 PC3 which provides in-depth information on how to design digital controllers for switch mode power converters.</p>",

This hybrid approach utilizes an embedded 8-bit microcontroller to customize the high performance analog power peripherals that provide the cycle by cycle control and protection of the power system. Once customized, the microcontroller resources are available to the system for adding intelligence, communication, diagnostics, measurements etc.. The phrase Digitally Enhanced Power Analog or DEPA describes how the high performance analog controller is enhanced by the integrated digital capability. DEPA will be compared with full digital control to address any confusion between the two distinct methods of switch mode power design. This class will introduce the newest products that support DEPA and how to take advantage of their capability by presenting several common application examples such as driving LEDs, charging batteries, meeting USB power requirements and developing unique features for ac/dc designs. If you are in need of solutions to new power system problems this class is for you.</p>",

In this class, youll learn about clock solutions beyond the internal RC oscillator provided in microcontrollers and microprocessors. We will study system architectures for various applications, and alternative clock solutions, including quartz crystals, self-contained quartz clocks, and MEMS-based clocks. EMI is a key concern of manufacturers, and well use a real-life case study to show how we achieved clock and data signal integrity in PCB design with a reduction of EMI-causing radiation. Finally, we will demonstrate Microchips tools, TimeFlash and Clockworks Configurator, that enable rapid creation and prototyping of customized clock solutions.</p>",

The peripherals discussed will include Peripheral Trigger Generator (PTG), Configurable Logic Cell (CLC), Multiple and Single Capture/Compare/PWM (MCCP and SCCP), Comparator/Op-amp, Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), Single Edge Nibble Transmission (SENT) and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). The extensive configurable features provided by these CIPs enable effective implementation of applications with minimal processor overhead. For example, the PTG module provides several features that enable close integration, synchronization and reconfiguration of other peripheral modules. Participants will be presented with several application case studies using creative  combinations of these peripherals, thereby gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of the flexibility and ease-of-use of these modules. In addition, there will be several hands-on lab exercises using a combination of these peripherals and the easy-to-use MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) software tool, to reinforce the concepts learned in this class.</p>",

The course will guide you through the development process of a CAN FD node by adding the MCP2517FD, a stand-alone CAN FD controller, to a microcontroller that does not support CAN FD. It will start with design requirements, teach you about considerations that are new to CAN FD, explain how CAN FD message databases are developed, and walk you through a typical CAN FD firmware application. The instructor will demonstrate how the physical layer can affect CAN FD communication, and how to debug some of the most common configuration mistakes.

In this class, a generalized approach to observer/estimator is presented and a working model of Microchip estimators will be discussed in detail. From motor equations, an equation based flux weakening algorithm is introduced which will eliminate any need for lookup tables for basic control of the motor. For IPMSM, saliency of the rotor produces an additional torque called reluctance torque. This class will include the use of MTPA algorithm to run the motor at most efficient operating point. This class  will also touch upon specific algorithms needed for fan control like Initial Position  Detection, Wind-milling, Stall Detection.This class will be theoretical session involving discussion around the motor model and motor control using motor equations. The implementation level details like fixed point, scaling, etc are outside of scope for this class and will not be discussed. </p>",

        "short-abstract": "<p>Typical motor control application usually deals with controlling the speed of a mechanical-system, for which a PI controller is sufficient. The controller for such an application can be tuned by trial-and-error. Though, trial-and-error is time consuming, it mostly will result in stable operation; but such a tuned application cannot be guranteed to be of optimum behaviour. The complexity becomes even higher, when we need to control the position of motor, under a very stringent requirement; where a PI controller will not lead to a stable behavior.This class demonstrates the fundamentals of control system by using a DC motor (the plant) as an example and compares the simulated behaviour of transfer function of the motor with its real behaviour. The class will explain the practical usage of control schemes such as P, PI, PID and lead compensator (the controllers) and will demonstrate the techniques to achieve an optimum behavior while controlling the DC motor. The audience should be familiar with basics of controlling a DC motor and control system theory such as pole/ zero, transfer function, stability, s-plane and root-locus plot etc..</p>",

        "short-abstract": "<p>This class demonstrates the power of IoT and how to harness it into our daily life. The simple demonstration involves monitoring and regulating water supply to the plant using sensors and actuators. What is a gateway and do I really need one? Consider a scenario where 100s of plants wants to connect to cloud thought a common Wi-Fi router - is this be possible? It is possible with additional routers and proper traffic management of data, but all this adds overhead cost to the setup because WiFi router has its limitations with the number of independent stations it can connect to. But with the help of gateways it is possible to achieve the same with less complexity and better power management. Gateways are simple systems consisting of WiFi Module and 802.15.4 transceiver running a Mesh stack (ZigBee). The 802.15.4 transceiver collects the data in its network and passes the data to the gateway for transmission. The gateway in our demo stores the received information from the plants and converts it into packets that can be sent to the cloud through WiFi, thus reducing the stress on the router. The demo consists of two custom made plant pots that store water for plants and water the plants when needed with the help of sensors and actuators.

In this class, we will use three sensors (which include light, temperature and humidity sensors), SAM B11 Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) solution, ATWINC1500 WiFi module and a PC/ Laptop for running HTTP server OR a cloud service provider. We will learn how to collect data from each sensor and send it over BLE, feed the collected sensor data from the BLE central node to ATWINC1500, demonstrate the BLE-WiFi gateway functionality to send the data from WINC1500 to the external IP network and display the data using a local or remote HTTP server. We will also cover live demonstration of triggering an alert message from one sensor and send back an alert response/counter action to the sensor.</p>",
