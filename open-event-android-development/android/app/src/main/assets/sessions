To some, switch mode converters are mysterious devices yet the basic principles of switch mode converters are fairly simple. This introductory class presents the principles and concepts of switch mode converters and lays the foundation needed for the more advanced power conversion classes. The class starts with a description of the basic components and circuits used in switch mode converters. Next, the fundamental principles of energy storage and processing common to all switch mode converters, inductor volt-second and capacitor charge balance, are presented. Using these principles, the operation of the most common switch mode converters is explained. Converters discussed in some detail include the buck, the boost, the forward, and the flyback converters. The class concludes with a survey of other common and important switch mode power converter topologies. After this class it is suggested than those interested in switch mode power take class 21098 PC2 which provides an introduction to feedback and control loops for switch mode power converters.</p>",

The extensive configurable features provided by these CIPs enable effective implementation of applications with minimal processor overhead. For example, the PTG module provides several features that enable close integration, synchronization and reconfiguration of other peripheral modules. Participants will be presented with several application case studies using creative  combinations of these peripherals, thereby gaining a deeper understanding and appreciation of the flexibility and ease-of-use of these modules.

Did you know that CAN FD is NOT backwards compatible to classic CAN? If you are familiar with classic CAN and want to learn about the new requirements for CAN FD and how to consider them in your next design, then this course is for you. The course will guide you through the development process of a CAN FD node by adding the MCP2517FD, a stand-alone CAN FD controller, to a microcontroller that does not support CAN FD. It will start with design requirements, teach you about considerations that are new to CAN FD, explain how CAN FD message databases are developed, and walk you through a typical CAN FD firmware application. The instructor will demonstrate how the physical layer can affect CAN FD communication, and how to debug some of the most common configuration mistakes. This is a lecture class but attendees can optionally attend the 21052 AN3L “Open Lab” session which will provide the opportunity to complete self-paced hands on lab exercises that reinforce concepts learned in this class. The Open Lab sessions will run some afternoons and some evenings. Exact times and locations for Open Lab evening sessions will be provided in class.</p>",

        "short-abstract": "<p>This class demonstrates the power of IoT and how to harness it into our daily life. The simple demonstration involves monitoring and regulating water supply to the plant using sensors and actuators. What is a gateway and do I really need one? Consider a scenario where 100s of plants wants to connect to cloud thought a common Wi-Fi router - is this be possible? It is possible with additional routers and proper traffic management of data, but all this adds overhead cost to the setup because WiFi router has its limitations with the number of independent stations it can connect to. But with the help of gateways it is possible to achieve the same with less complexity and better power management. Gateways are simple systems consisting of WiFi Module and 802.15.4 transceiver running a Mesh stack (ZigBee). The 802.15.4 transceiver collects the data in its network and passes the data to the gateway for transmission. The gateway in our demo stores the received information from the plants and converts it into packets that can be sent to the cloud through WiFi, thus reducing the stress on the router. The demo consists of two custom made plant pots that store water for plants and water the plants when needed with the help of sensors and actuators. The real-time stats like amount of water consumed, moisture level and water level are displayed in real time on a portable device connected to a local server or internet. </p>",

        "short-abstract": "<p>Typical motor control application usually deals with controlling the speed of a mechanical-system, for which a PI controller is sufficient. The controller for such an application can be tuned by trial-and-error. Though, trial-and-error is time consuming, it mostly will result in stable operation; but such a tuned application cannot be guranteed to be of optimum behaviour. The complexity becomes even higher, when we need to control the position of motor, under a very stringent requirement; where a PI controller will not lead to a stable behavior.This class demonstrates the fundamentals of control system by using a DC motor (the plant) as an example and compares the simulated behaviour of transfer function of the motor with its real behaviour. The class will explain the practical usage of control schemes such as P, PI, PID and lead compensator (the controllers) and will demonstrate the techniques to achieve an optimum behavior while controlling the DC motor. The audience should be familiar with basics of controlling a DC motor and control system theory such as pole/ zero, transfer function, stability, s-plane and root-locus plot etc..</p>",

For IPMSM, saliency of the rotor produces an additional torque called reluctance torque. This class will include the use of MTPA algorithm to run the motor at most efficient operating point. This class  will also touch upon specific algorithms needed for fan control like Initial Position  Detection, Wind-milling, Stall Detection.This class will be theoretical session involving discussion around the motor model and motor control using motor equations.

Then each element of analog feedback controllers are presented and discussed: the error amplifier, the compensator, and the modulator. Particular attention is paid to designing the control loop frequency response to achieve both stability and good performance. While there is a fair amount of algebra used the focus of the discussion is on understanding the concepts and principles. The last part of the class is an overview of current mode control and its advantages.

Once customized, the microcontroller resources are available to the system for adding intelligence, communication, diagnostics, measurements etc.. The phrase Digitally Enhanced Power Analog or DEPA describes how the high performance analog controller is enhanced by the integrated digital capability. DEPA will be compared with full digital control to address any confusion between the two distinct methods of switch mode power design. This class will introduce the newest products that support DEPA and how to take advantage of their capability by presenting several common application examples such as driving LEDs, charging batteries, meeting USB power requirements and developing unique features for ac/dc designs.

You will learn the parts of the stack fundamental to all TCP/IP applications, how to configure the stack, and how to interface your application to the stack. This class will show you the supported protocols, example demo code, and support utilities provided by the stack. We will describe the architecture of the stack and how it works and show some common stack APIs used to interface your application with the stack (socket programming). You will get hands on experience with configuring the stack using the MPLAB Harmony Configuration (MHC) Tool, and creating a TCP/IP application using a \"bare metal\" implementation.Note: This class is not relevant for Microchips stand-alone RN Wi-Fi® modules.</p>",

This class helps you to find out how these sensory organs of the internet of things can be designed using our SAMB11 (BlueSDK) and ATWINC1500 (WiFi module). In this class, we will use three sensors (which include light, temperature and humidity sensors), SAM B11 Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) solution, ATWINC1500 WiFi module and a PC/ Laptop for running HTTP server OR a cloud service provider. We will learn how to collect data from each sensor and send it over BLE, feed the collected sensor data from the BLE central node to ATWINC1500, demonstrate the BLE-WiFi gateway functionality to send the data from WINC1500 to the external IP network and display the data using a local or remote HTTP server. We will also cover live demonstration of triggering an alert message from one sensor and send back an alert response/counter action to the sensor.</p>",

        "short-abstract": "<p>This class demonstrates the power of IoT and how to harness it into our daily life. The simple demonstration involves monitoring and regulating water supply to the plant using sensors and actuators. What is a gateway and do I really need one? Consider a scenario where 100s of plants wants to connect to cloud thought a common Wi-Fi router - is this be possible? It is possible with additional routers and proper traffic management of data, but all this adds overhead cost to the setup because WiFi router has its limitations with the number of independent stations it can connect to. But with the help of gateways it is possible to achieve the same with less complexity and better power management. Gateways are simple systems consisting of WiFi Module and 802.15.4 transceiver running a Mesh stack (ZigBee). The 802.15.4 transceiver collects the data in its network and passes the data to the gateway for transmission. The gateway in our demo stores the received information from the plants and converts it into packets that can be sent to the cloud through WiFi, thus reducing the stress on the router. The demo consists of two custom made plant pots that store water for plants and water the plants when needed with the help of sensors and actuators. The real-time stats like amount of water consumed, moisture level and water level are displayed in real time on a portable device connected to a local server or internet. </p>",

In this class, youll learn about clock solutions beyond the internal RC oscillator provided in microcontrollers and microprocessors. We will study system architectures for various applications, and alternative clock solutions, including quartz crystals, self-contained quartz clocks, and MEMS-based clocks. EMI is a key concern of manufacturers, and well use a real-life case study to show how we achieved clock and data signal integrity in PCB design with a reduction of EMI-causing radiation. Finally, we will demonstrate Microchips tools, TimeFlash and Clockworks Configurator, that enable rapid creation and prototyping of customized clock solutions.</p>",
